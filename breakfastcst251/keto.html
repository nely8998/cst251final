		<h1>Keto</h1>
    <p>For the ones who want to consider a keto diet this section is for you. There are many health benefits when considering this diet. Although it can be
			diifficult to get rid of bad eating habits, it takes 91 days to build a new one. Many young folks are enrolled in college but never encouraged beside
			academia to eat healthy. The food that you consume has an impact on the way you feel and think. It is important to start building those new habits
			while you're still young. If the support of eating healthy isn’t in school there are many free resources online to help you make that change.
			 We included two dishes and two drinks to get you started. As you can see by the ingredients you can still have that good taste and not a boring
			  diet. Anything is possible but here is the list of health benefits when it comes to being on a keto diet.

      <h1>Instructions</h1>
      <p>Step one, Grease a 9X13 casserole dish and preheat oven to 350°F. Step two, Fry bacon on the stove or bake in the oven (whichever method you prefer).
				When done, drain and set aside to cool. When the bacon has cooled, crumble into bite-sized pieces. Step 3 In a medium-sized skillet ( I used a
				10.25 inch cast iron) melt butter. Step four, In a bowl, crack eggs and add heavy whipping cream, salt, and pepper. Whisk until thoroughly combined.
       Step five,Pour egg mixture into skillet and scramble eggs. Remove from heat right before they get done and continue stirring as they will continue to
			 cook, but removing from the heat will prevent them from overcooking. Step six, In a low carb tortilla, spoon eggs down the middle follow with bacon and freshly shredded cheddar cheese.
			  Roll low carb burritos and place seam side down in a casserole dish. (Reserve 1/4 cup of the cheddar cheese and some of the crumbled bacon to use as toppings for the burritos in the casserole dish before baking.)
 Step seven,Repeat the above step until the casserole dish is full. (I used seven burritos, but I left one out for meal prep photo). Sprinkle 1/4 cup white cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup sharp cheddar cheese on top of the burritos and
 sprinkle a handful of the crumbled bacon on top. Step eight, You can cover and put in the fridge and bake the next morning. If so, bake covered for 15 minutes, then remove foil and bake for an additional 5-7 min or until heated all
  the way through and cheese is melted on top. If baking immediately, bake for 10-15 minutes or until heated all the way through. Enjoy!
